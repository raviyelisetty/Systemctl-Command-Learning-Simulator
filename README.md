In Linux systems, managing services is a critical skill for system administrators and 
developers. The systemctl command is central to controlling systemd services, but practicing 
these commands directly on live systems can be risky and intimidating for beginners. The 
Systemctl Web Learning Simulator solves this by offering a browser-based platform where 
users can safely experiment with systemctl commands in a simulated environment. Users can 
type real commands (e.g., systemctl start nginx or systemctl status sshd) and receive realistic, 
interactive feedbackâ€”without any risk to a real system. This tool makes Linux service 
management more approachable by providing guided tutorials, instant feedback, and a safe 
space for trial and error. It helps learners build confidence and competence in service control, 
while reducing setup time and eliminating the risk of breaking a production system.
