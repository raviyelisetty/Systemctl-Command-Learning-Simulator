### Systemctl Command Learning Simulator

### 📘 Overview

The **Systemctl Command Learning Simulator** is a **web-based educational tool** designed to help users safely learn and practice Linux `systemctl` commands.  
It mimics the real command-line environment, letting learners execute simulated `systemctl` commands (like `start`, `stop`, `enable`, `status`) without touching an actual Linux system.

This project is especially useful for **beginners** and **cyber security trainees** who want to master Linux service management safely.

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement

Practicing `systemctl` commands on live Linux systems can be risky for new learners.  
Mistakes might lead to service disruption or system instability, and setting up safe virtual machines is time-consuming.

The simulator provides a **controlled, browser-based environment** that allows users to safely experiment with `systemctl` commands — complete with realistic feedback and tutorials.

---

### 🎯 Project Objectives

- ✅ Provide a safe, web-based environment for `systemctl` command practice  
- ✅ Simulate realistic systemd service responses  
- ✅ Offer guided tutorials and instant feedback  
- ✅ Enable learning without requiring a Linux installation  
- ✅ Help users build confidence in Linux service management

### 🚀 Features

- 🖥️ **Interactive terminal interface** for entering real `systemctl` commands  
- ⚙️ **Simulation of services** like `nginx`, `sshd`, and `docker`  
- 📘 **Step-by-step tutorials** and command examples  
- 🧭 **Feedback and hints** for incorrect commands  
- 🧑‍💻 **Browser-based**, no installation or Linux setup required  
- 🌐 **Responsive design** for all devices
